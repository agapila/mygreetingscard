# mygreetingscard
A project for a greeting card for Udacity Android Beginners course
I created a RelativeLayout with ImageViews positioned centrally (one centrally and two other relative to the central one) and TextViews positioned in the corners and top and bottom of the parent. I hard coded the sizes of the ImageViews and TextViews and as an effect they overlap on some devices, so I would like to learn how to code those sizes relative to the available screen real estate.
